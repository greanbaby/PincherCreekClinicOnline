    <ul>
      <li>1st spray double-booked with doctor </li>
      <li>Follow-up sprays done by LPN</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="tit">Connect Care Discussion</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Discussion on the new labs forms from Dynalife</li>
      <li>The ordering provider will need to be on the lab requisition forms. Also make sure their name is on the form</li>
      <li>If any other person is filling out a lab requisition please make sure the doctors name is on the form and not our personal names</li>
      <li>Doc.com for clinic paneled patients and family doc to be on lab requisitions for follow-up lab work especially if locums are working in the ER</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="tit">Pre-Natal Clinic LRH</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Will need the prenatal lists in advance to ensure those referrals are happening at the 26 week mark and then returning to clinic. Scott has been working on this list</li>
      <li>Prenatal clinic at the LRH are for those patients 26 + weeks. OB/ GYN doctors will see patients once they are past 34+ weeks</li>
      <li>Referrals for the LRH Prenatal clinic are being sent through the Breast/ Cervical Health Clinic. Transcription is aware of this process</li>
      <li>1.	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Initial visit @ 26 weeks @ LRH prenatal clinic </li>
      <li>2.	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Follow-up visits can/ will be held at the patients home clinic </li>
      <li>3.	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After 34+ weeks you will see the OB/GYN in Lethbridge </li>
    </ul>


    <p class="tit">Pre-Natal Pincher Creek</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Booking regular scheduled follow-ups -- suggestions</li>
      <li>Clinic panel pts that have not followed or no showed and tracking same. Scott is working on a list to identify these patients for reception to call</li>
      <li>LPN are booking 30 min intervals for seeing prenatal patients. We have seen an increase in walk in patients for confirming prenatals</li>
      <li>Overall this process is working great for the LPNs and doctors </li> 
    </ul>


    <p class="tit">Process change for booking Holter Monitor & Blood Pressure Monitors</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Since Lorna was away for a month we have been notified that Lorna will be booking the holter and blood pressure monitors. Reception prints off the tickler sent by the doctor and they attach a patient label and fax to the hospital</li>
      <li>Reception would like to make sure that we are receiving a date and time for the patients appt to get the Holter and blood pressure monitors done from Lorna at the hospital. This way we can complete the ticker with this information</li>
      <li>Lorna at the PC Hospital will book the appointments and phone the patients</li>
    </ul>


    <p class="tit">Process for Screening Follow-Up</p>
    <p>We did have a long discussion on this topic. A more specific way of measuring will be decided.  Some suggestions were comparing how many paps we do monthly? Are we increasing that number each month?  
We would compare this from the previous year – Jan to March 2022 compared to Jan-March 2023 , have we improved? 
    </p>
    <p>Differentiating between regular screening and a follow up; ie when pts fall out of the screening parameters they become a follow up with a tickler
When their screening is normal they continue to stay on the regular follow up list without a tickler
    </p>
    <p>Scott is trying an out of parameter list with the PAPs
New list made to identify those pts without a a tickler that present outside normal screening
Can work this into our other preventions as well
    </p>
    <p>LPNs are tagging patients who are due for what screening prior to them being seen in clinic. 
Regular screening will be done to all patients that need them. If your screening is abnormal you are no longer required to do screening but will become a follow-up and a tickler is then generated. 
    </p>


    <p class="tit">Heart failure follow ups post discharge; 24 hour BP follow ups</p>
    <ul>
      <li>This topic was tabled until next meeting</li>

Clinic staff are also advised to check if they are up to date on this and all immunizations. Encourage patients to immunize @Clinics and PH -Pharmacy not providing dTap.
        (Due to recent increase in cases, all locally acquired, an outbreak has been declared for the County of Lethbridge, Taber Municipal District, and Bow Island. DTaP immunization rates for children in these areas are low, ranging from 30-45% of 2-year-olds having 4 doses of DTaP immunization. Of identified cases in this outbreak, 63% are unimmunized, 31% are partially immunized, and 6% are up-to-date on immunizations. There is concern that there is more pertussis circulating in the community, as many people with the disease may not seek medical attention. Therefore, we are requesting physician awareness, identification of cases and early treatment to prevent further transmission.)

      <li class="uti">Ensure height is also documented in patient's chart and BMI if possible</li>
      <li class="uti">If labs are back they will update the chart as well</li>
      <li class="uti">Tickler to be sent to notify MD at 28 weeks if blood type negative for rhogam and at 30 weeks for dtap</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="uti">2. Ongoing prenatal visits MOA to input the BP and weight directly into the prenatal record and not put it in Health Tracker as long as one weight and BP has been recorded within the past year</p>

    <p class="tit">Follow up from Tess re: ED Visits for Asthma/COPD and CHF</p>
    <p class="uti">Reminder concerning out patient sheets and the discharge diagnosis:  
      This diagnosis should read URTI / Asthma, 
      this way we will then know that this patient does have underlying asthma 
      which could then be put into the disease registry. 
    </p>
    
    <br><br><br>
    <p class="tit">Screening Process</p>

      <li>Discussion on where to put  information for preventions for patients.   Dr. Bev has let us know that they do not look at the Health Tracker to find out patients information about their preventions. There are many ways to put preventions into Juno, however as discussed we need to have one place that all clinic staff and doctors will be able to locate the information.  After a lengthy discussion it was decided that we would only use “Preventions” to collect this information</li>
      <li>As follows:</li>
      <li>Go to Summary </li>
      <li>Left column at the top “ Preventions” </li>
      <li>Click on any of the following listed and it will bring you to the Preventions list. This is where you will add your information. An email will be sent out with the same information to all staff and doctors. 
        We will also be using the Disease Registry to register all diagnoses including: Diabetes, hypertension, diverticulosis, etc. </li>
      <li class="todo">If there are any questions please don’t hesitate to ask Cheryl Dolan</li>
      <li>Transcription will also add diagnoses to a patients chart if the doctor dictates such  and will also put in the surgical history under “Medical history “ in the summary</li>
      <li class="todo">Cheryl will follow-up with the LPN”s on how the “Preventions” process is working</li>

    <ul>
      <li>Please see the attached numbers for Affiliation Forms</li>
      <li>Any patient going forward from today will need to have an affiliation form completed prior to having an appointment with a doctor. This also includes prescriptions ,  Home Care requisitions</li>
      <li>We are concerned about those patients being able to book online appointments but a discussion was held and we are looking into changing the text message that goes out. This might include the following information, “ if you have not signed an affiliation form with our clinic prior to your appointment, your appointment will be cancelled “ </li>
      <li>More information on this to be followed</li>
    </ul>


    <p class="tit">UTI Process</p>
    <p class="article">Symptomatic urinary tract infection patients will come in and drop off a urine. At this time nursing will get a history , check the urine and then nursing will discuss with the doctor if patient will need to be seen. </p>

  <section class="meeting">
    <h2>Feb. 2, 2023</h2>
    <p class="tit">Follow up from January 26 meeting</p>
    <p class="uti">Follow up cervical screening challenge</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="uti">Still a lot of no shows. In January Laura had 38 paps booked and 11 of these were no shows</li>
      <li>Tagging the appts the docs are finding very helpful. Those appt booked with short notice are being missed but we are getting the majority</li>
      <li>Bev and Tracy looking at doing a pap ONLY clinic one Saturday</li>
      <li>Would have to be very scripted that this is for a pap only and nothing else will be discussed. 10 minutes per appt</li>
      <li>Would need 1 person to work as MOA and 1 reception to work those dates.  Support from staff on this</li>
    </ul>
    <br>


    <p class="tit">Prental Process</p>
    <p class="uti">Update to process to involve nursing moving forward</p>
    <ul>
      <li>1st prenatals will be meeting with LPN 15 min before their appt with physician to start the prenatal record and get weight etc. </li>
      <li class="todo">Scott will create a pregnancy template to catch those patients closer to 20 weeks.</li>
      <li class="todo">Joanne will continue to follow up with Juno to find out how prenatals should be closed.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>


    <p class="tit">Diagnosis List</p>
    <p class="uti">This is best captured in the DISEASE REGISTRY</p>
    <p>Need to inform</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Physicians</li>
      <li>Nursing</li>
      <li>Transcription</li>
    </ul>
    <br>


    <p class="tit">Additional Functionality</p>
    <p class="uti">Review of Grease Monkey functions for lab review and where to apply next.   Continued from last meeting</p>
    <ul>
      <li>FITs will be the next one</li>
      <li class="todo">Scott will work on this</li>
    </ul>
    <br>


    <p class="tit">Affiliation Forms</p>
    <p class="uti">Forms still needed as of Feb. 1 is about 2,700</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Discussion about creating an “unaffiliated panel” for those who have not signed 
        to make it easy for reception to catch those trying to book appts 
        if no form as well as prescription refills coming in</li>
      <li>Would be much easier/faster on reception  if able to see MRP</li>
      <li>Forms for all of Ashley’s panel not done yet have been mailed out</li>
      <li>Clinic panel  forms will be done being mailed to those not signed today</li>
      <li>Then we will continue to move on to other physicians</li>
      <li class="todo">Scott will look at prioritizing to see if Grease monkey can display MRP</li>
      <li>Prescription refills are being sent back now on those patients who have not signed. Next steps pending if Scott is able to create the MRP showing in Juno.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>


    <p class="tit">Entering follow ups and refusals of care</p>
    <p class="uti">Scott's feedback for inputting refusals:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Regarding the “Refused” entries for Preventions in Juno that we were talking about last Thursday:</li>
      <li class="todo">If you could also put the Next Date for these Refused entries then that would be great because all of the current reporting should just work if we do it this way.</li>
      <li class="todo">So, we would put “Pap” preventions, “Refused” and “Next Date” of 1 year from now</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="uti">Further discussion and next steps:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Last meeting Lisa was separating each prevention under its own category however this has went back to original as it was too “messy”.</li>
      <li>Scott’s working on screening numbers he will come up with something to be displayed  in coffee room on an ongoing basis so it can be visualized for staff</li>
    </ul>
