      <li>If someone falls outside of the regular screening perimeters 
        a tickler should occur with any screening</li>
      <li>Discussed hysterectomies and that patients who have had this procedure

      <li class="oli">Since December 2022, 16 cases of pertussis have been identified, including 3 children hospitalized in January. All adults are eligible to have a booster of DTaP every 10 years. Clinic staff are also advised to check if they are up to date on this and all immunizations. Encourage patients to immunize @Clinics and PH -Pharmacy not providing dTap.
        (Due to recent increase in cases, all locally acquired, an outbreak has been declared for the County of Lethbridge, Taber Municipal District, and Bow Island. DTaP immunization rates for children in these areas are low, ranging from 30-45% of 2-year-olds having 4 doses of DTaP immunization. Of identified cases in this outbreak, 63% are unimmunized, 31% are partially immunized, and 6% are up-to-date on immunizations. There is concern that there is more pertussis circulating in the community, as many people with the disease may not seek medical attention. Therefore, we are requesting physician awareness, identification of cases and early treatment to prevent further transmission.)

    <p class="tit">Follow up from Tess re: ED Visits for Asthma/COPD and CHF</p>
    <p class="uti">Reminder concerning out patient sheets and the discharge diagnosis:  
      This diagnosis should read URTI / Asthma, 
      this way we will then know that this patient does have underlying asthma 
      which could then be put into the disease registry. 
    </p>

      <li>LPN Laura and Dr. Bev and Dr. Tracy are setting up a pap clinic on March 7, 2022 to try and increase our  screening numbers</li>

      <li>Discussion on where to put  information for preventions for patients.   Dr. Bev has let us know that they do not look at the Health Tracker to find out patients information about their preventions. There are many ways to put preventions into Juno, however as discussed we need to have one place that all clinic staff and doctors will be able to locate the information.  After a lengthy discussion it was decided that we would only use “Preventions” to collect this information</li>
      <li>As follows:</li>
      <li>Go to Summary </li>
      <li>Left column at the top “ Preventions” </li>
      <li>Click on any of the following listed and it will bring you to the Preventions list. This is where you will add your information. An email will be sent out with the same information to all staff and doctors. 
        We will also be using the Disease Registry to register all diagnoses including: Diabetes, hypertension, diverticulosis, etc. </li>
      <li class="todo">If there are any questions please don’t hesitate to ask Cheryl Dolan</li>
      <li>Transcription will also add diagnoses to a patients chart if the doctor dictates such  and will also put in the surgical history under “Medical history “ in the summary</li>
      <li class="todo">Cheryl will follow-up with the LPN”s on how the “Preventions” process is working</li>
    </ul>
