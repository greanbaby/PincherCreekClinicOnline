    <li class="oli">Since December 2022, 16 cases of pertussis have been identified, including 3 children hospitalized in January. All adults are eligible to have a booster of DTaP every 10 years. Clinic staff are also advised to check if they are up to date on this and all immunizations. Encourage patients to immunize @Clinics and PH -Pharmacy not providing dTap.
      (Due to recent increase in cases, all locally acquired, an outbreak has been declared for the County of Lethbridge, Taber Municipal District, and Bow Island. DTaP immunization rates for children in these areas are low, ranging from 30-45% of 2-year-olds having 4 doses of DTaP immunization. Of identified cases in this outbreak, 63% are unimmunized, 31% are partially immunized, and 6% are up-to-date on immunizations. There is concern that there is more pertussis circulating in the community, as many people with the disease may not seek medical attention. Therefore, we are requesting physician awareness, identification of cases and early treatment to prevent further transmission.)
